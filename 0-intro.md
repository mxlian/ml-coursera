## What is machine learning?

> "Field that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
programmed" - Arthur Samuel (1959)

## Supervised learning

The algorithm is provided with a data-set of "corrected answers".

Problems that use to be solved:

* Regression
* Classification

## Unsupervised learning

The algorithm is just fed with data and it's trys to make some inferences.

* Clustering problem (google News: grouping related news, genoma, etc)
* Cocktail party problem (separete data comming together in different
streams
